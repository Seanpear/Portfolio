Hi! I'm a motivated and curious student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science & Sustainability. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with data and communicating science in creative ways. This website is a space for me to share my academic journey, showcase skills, and connect with others who care about environmental sustainability. My goal is to consistently highlight the importance of values such as curiosity, collaboration, and adaptability.
